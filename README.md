# mnist-classification
This repo contains the code and report for the Neural Networks course at Leiden University for the academic year 2019-2020. We employ a simplified version of the MNIST dataset that comprises of 1707 and 1000 images for training and test sets. The report includes a detailed explanation of problem questions, experiments, theory and conclusions. We implemented a distance based classifier, an multi class perceptron from scratch, investigate linear separability and solve the XOR problem.
